# Data-Management-DIT032
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology.

The purpose of this course is to give students a solid theoretical and practical background in the fundamentals of database design and usage. A focus is put on data management from a software developer's point of view. Further, in addition to traditional data modelling topics, relational theory, and SQL, the course teaches modern database concepts, such as soft-state NoSQL databases, Big Data, and Map/Reduce. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to design, implement, and use a range of different database technologies in their software projects.
